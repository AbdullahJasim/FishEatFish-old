# FishEatFish-old

***This is not representative of my current code. This is an old project. For the redone version check: https://github.com/AbdullahJasim/FishEatFish-new

This was my introduction to progamming, and it was in Processing (a Java based language). I struggled to get the main features of the game to work, but it was a lot of fun and it was what got me into programming. I have decided to redo this project as well, this time using Directx 11 (C++, Visual Studio).

The game has simple rules:
1. The player has a limited number of lives
2. If two fish are facing each other and within collision distance, then the bigger fish eats the smaller one
3. If the player fish eats another, it will grow
4. If an enemy fish eats the player, the player will lose a life
5. When the player loses a life, the fish will respawn with the starting size and location, and will have a few frames of invulnerability
6. Eating a fish grants +5 score
7. A shark fish will be swimming around. The player cannot eat the shark fish
